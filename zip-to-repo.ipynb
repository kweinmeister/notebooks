        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook provides a streamlined workflow to take a ZIP file from your Google Drive and push its contents into a new or existing GitHub repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What This Tool Does**\n",
        "It automates the entire process of getting source code or other project files from a Drive link into a version-controlled repository on GitHub.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Required Preparation**\n",
        "Before you begin, you will need three things:\n",
        "1.  **A Google Drive Link:** A sharable link to the `.zip` file you want to upload. This can be a standard Drive link or a link from an application like AI Studio.\n",
        "2.  **A GitHub Repository:** A repository (either new or existing, public or private) on GitHub to push the files to.\n",
        "3.  **A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):** A PAT with `repo` scope is required for the notebook to authenticate with GitHub.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Three-Step Workflow**\n",
        "1.  **Step 1: Get File from Google Drive**\n",
        "    *   You will provide the link to your file.\n",
        "    *   The notebook authenticates with your Google account and downloads the file's content into the Colab environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Step 2: Unpack the ZIP Archive**\n",
        "    *   This step verifies the downloaded file is a valid ZIP archive.\n",
        "    *   It then unpacks the contents into a clean folder, ready to be committed to Git.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Step 3: Push Contents to GitHub Repository**\n",
        "    *   You will provide your GitHub details and the name of a Colab Secret (üîë) where your PAT is stored.\n",
        "    *   The notebook clones your repository, copies the project files into it, and pushes the new commit back to GitHub."
