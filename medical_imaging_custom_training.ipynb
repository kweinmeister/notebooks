    "### Traffic split\n",
    "\n",
    "The `traffic_split` parameter is specified as a Python dictionary. You can deploy more than one instance of your model to an endpoint, and then set the percentage of traffic that goes to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a traffic split to introduce a new model gradually into production. For example, if you had one existing model in production with 100% of the traffic, you could deploy a new model to the same endpoint, direct 10% of traffic to it, and reduce the original model's traffic to 90%. This allows you to monitor the new model's performance while minimizing the distruption to the majority of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compute instance scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify a single instance (or node) to serve your online prediction requests. This tutorial uses a single node, so the variables `MIN_NODES` and `MAX_NODES` are both set to `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use multiple nodes to serve your online prediction requests, set `MAX_NODES` to the maximum number of nodes you want to use. Vertex AI autoscales the number of nodes used to serve your predictions, up to the maximum number you set. Refer to the [pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#prediction-prices) to understand the costs of autoscaling with multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The method will block until the model is deployed and eventually return an `Endpoint` object. If this is the first time a model is deployed to the endpoint, it may take a few additional minutes to complete provisioning of resources."
